/**
 * <p>This class provides information about the state in which transitions for a given character sequence 
 * ended up when computing the hash code of this sequence in a {@link eu.danieldk.dictomaton.PerfectHashDictionary}.</p>
 * <p>It is possible to resume a transition using a StateInfo object to define the start state in {@link PerfectHashDictionary#getStateInfo(CharSequence, StateInfo)} 
 * <p>Example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * 
 * PerfectHashDictionary dict; // dictionary containing sequences "abc" and "abc def" 
 * String seq = "abc def";
 * 
 * StateInfo info1 = dict.getStateInfo(seq.subSequence(0, 3));
 * 
 * if (info1.isInFinalState()) {
 *   int hash1 = info1.getHash(); // hash1 contains the hash for "abc"
 * }
 * 
 * if (info1.isInKnownState()) {
 * 
 *   // regardless of whether we are in a final state after "abc", as long as
 *   // we are in a known state (= the sequence is contained in the dictionary) 
 *   // we can resume the transition after "abc"
 *   
 *   StateInfo info2 = dict.getStateInfo(seq.subSequence(3, seq.length()), info1);
 *   if (info2.isInFinalState()) {
 *      int hash2 = info2.getHash(); // hash2 contains the hash for "abc def"
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * }
 * </pre>
